# TodoList

A really simple TodoList project built using Angular to start learning the concepts of two way data binding, and generally gain a familiarity for using the framework. Very lightly styled using Bootstrap. Deployed here: https://hardcore-jennings-b409db.netlify.app/

## Usage

```
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```
